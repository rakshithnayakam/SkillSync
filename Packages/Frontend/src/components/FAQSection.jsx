        answer: "SkillSync is a peer-to-peer exchange platform. You offer a skill you possess (e.g., cooking) in exchange for a skill you want to learn (e.g., Spanish). Our matching algorithm connects users with complementary skills and learning goals.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is SkillSync really free?",
        answer: "Yes! Our Basic plan is entirely free, offering core features like skill matching and a limited number of exchanges per month. We also offer affordable Pro and Teams plans for unlimited exchanges and advanced features.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does a typical skill exchange take?",
        answer: "Exchange duration varies based on the skills and user preferences, but most structured exchanges last between 6 and 12 weeks, with a recommended weekly session time.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm not satisfied with my match?",
        answer: "We offer a built-in resolution process and guarantee satisfaction. If a match isn't working, you can easily switch partners. Paid plans include dedicated support to ensure successful pairings.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I exchange multiple skills at once?",
        answer: "Yes, advanced users often participate in multiple simultaneous exchanges, both teaching and learning different skills. The Pro plan facilitates this with unlimited exchanges.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do you ensure quality and safety?",
        answer: "All users are verified, and we rely on community ratings and feedback. We provide safety guidelines and moderation to maintain a high-quality and trustworthy environment.",
    },
    {
        question: "What types of skills can I learn or teach?",
        answer: "Our categories cover everything from Programming and Design to Languages, Cooking, Fitness, and DIY & Crafts. If you have a skill, you can probably exchange it!",
    },
    {
        question: "How does the gamification system work?",
        answer: "Our gamification system awards Skill Points, Badges, and Levels for participation, successful exchanges, and positive feedback, encouraging continuous learning and mentoring.",
